# What's Cooking: Recipie Classifier

In this final project, I  analyzed the recipe dataset to predict the cuisine based on the ingredients mentioned through a structured machine learning workflow. The workflow included Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, and Model Fitting and Evaluation. I fitted three different classification models and selected Support Vector Classifier as the final model based on the accuracy score on the validation dataset. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to identify the optimal parameters for Support Vector Classifier. The final model achieved a score of  ‘0.81063’ on the test dataset when submitted on Kaggle.
