# What's Cooking: Recipie Classifier

This project involves predicting the cuisine type based on ingredients listed in a recipe dataset. The workflow follows a structured machine learning pipeline, which includes the following steps:

## Workflow Overview:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigated the dataset to understand the distributions, relationships, and any potential issues in the data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features or transformed existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Model Fitting and Evaluation**: Tested multiple classification algorithms and evaluated their performance using accuracy scores on the validation set.

## Models Used:
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
- Additional classification models were also tested, but **SVC** was selected as the final model based on superior performance on the validation dataset.

## Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Conducted hyperparameter optimization on the Support Vector Classifier to identify the optimal settings for the model.

## Results:
- The final model achieved an **accuracy score of 0.81063** on the test dataset, as submitted to Kaggle.
